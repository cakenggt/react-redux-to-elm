					<h1>React-Redux to Elm</h1>
					<i>https://cakenggt.github.io/react-redux-to-elm</i>
					<aside class="notes">
						Show how many familiar features of React-Redux map to
						features in Elm. The two are very similar, as Redux
						was modeled after Elm.

						I'm going to go through the concepts familar between
						both of them, showing how they are similar and different.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Store</h2>
						<p>
							The store keeps the state of the application
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							It can be read and transformed.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>React-Redux</h2>
						<p>The store comes from the default store parameter in the reducer or reducers</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							If using combineReducers, the structure is gotten from the input map
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Elm</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Structure defined by the Model type</li>
							<li>Initialized by the init function</li>
							<li>Transformed by the update function</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							The Model type definition is not passed to the program,
							just the init, update, subscription, and view functions.
							The structure of the store is defined as whatever the init function outputs
							and the update function takes in and returns.
						</aside>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Reducer</h2>
						<p>
							Reducers transform the store in response to an action
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							When we say transform, we actually mean that a new store is returned.
							In Elm this is taken care of with Immutable data types,
							but in JavaScript we need to do this ourselves.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>React-Redux</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Function that takes in the current store and action</li>
							<li>Returns the transformed store</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Elm</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Takes in the current store and a Msg</li>
							<li>Returns a tuple containing the new store and a Cmd (Side Effect)</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							React-Redux has no built-in ability to deal with side-effects while
							still keeping it's reducers pure like Elm does.
							We have to use third party libraries.
						</aside>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Side Effects</h2>
						<p>Anything outside of a pure function</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							A pure function is defined as

							<ol>
								<li>Always evaluates the same result value given the same argument value(s).</li>
								<li>Causes no side effect, such as mutation or I/O</li>
							</ol>

							Programs usually have to have Side Effects, and React-Redux
							and Elm handle their creation differently. The goal is not to
							not have side effects, but to isolate any side effect producing
							code as much as possible.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>React-Redux</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Use the Thunk middleware to dispatch a function instead of an object</li>
							<li>This keeps your reducer pure and moves side effect creation to the Thunk function</li>
							<aside class="notes">
								It is still up to the developer to keep side effect producing
								code out of their reducer, moving it into the Thunk.
							</aside>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Elm</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Commands are used to do such things as AJAX and generating random numbers</li>
							<li>Commands are given a Msg type as an argument, which they call the update function with</li>
							<li>
								For example, instead of a .then from a promise or a callback function
								used to retrieve the result of an AJAX request, the result is passed
								in a given Msg type, which is evaluated just like all other Msg types
								in the update function
							</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							You literally cannot put side effect producing code in your reducer, as all
							side effects are handled with commands.
						</aside>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Component</h2>
						<p>An abstract structure used to create HTML</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>React-Redux</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Can be either functional or a React class</li>
							<li>JSX Formatting</li>
							<li>App must be connected to the store using the Provider component</li>
							<li>Each component must be connected to the store with the connect function to look at the store or dispatch actions to it</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Elm</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Functional: Must return an Html Msg</li>
							<li>No JSX formatting, uses only functions imported from the Html and Html.Attributes libraries</li>
							<li>The view function is given the model when called, which it can then pass to any component functions</li>
							<li>The view function must ultimately return an Html Msg</li>
							<li>When a Msg is produced, it automatically gets sent to the update function</li>
							<li>Msg's are produced through the on* attributes of an HTML element, imported from Html.Events</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							The biggest difference between these two is that with Elm
							you don't have to set up the connections between the
							components and the store manually, it is handled for
							you.
						</aside>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>External Events</h2>
						<p>Events which originate outside of the app, with no initiation from the app</p>
						<i>WebSockets, not AJAX</i>
						<aside class="notes">
							AJAX is initiated by the code, so the code expects
							some sort of result or error value. However, WebSockets
							can emit events without any interaction from your side.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>React-Redux</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Middleware is suggested</li>
							<li>Middleware can dispatch actions based on events outside of React-Redux</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Elm</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Subscriptions are registered with a Msg type</li>
							<li>When data comes in, it is attached to the Msg type given, and sent to the update function</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							You say what you want to subscribe to, and give it one
							of your Msg types that it will dispatch when it receives
							an event. If you want something to happen every second,
							or to evaluate a WebSocket emit, you use subscriptions.
						</aside>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Breaking up a complex app</h2>
						<p>
							Sometimes apps get too big to put in one file. How are they split up?
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>React-Redux</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Multiple reducers can be combined using combineReducers</li>
							<li>Functionality is separated by store key</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Elm</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Each section has it's own custom Msg type, Model type, and update function, which it exports</li>
							<li>The main Elm file will import all of the custom Msg types, Models, and update functions</li>
							<li>Custom Msg types are unioned together using the pipe character</li>
							<li>Custom Models are combined into the main model type using a map with keys</li>
							<li>Custom update functions are called in the main update function, which uses a case statement on custom Msg type</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							This is very similar to React-Redux, the main
							difference being that you have to manually
							pass only the important sub-section of the total
							model to each update function in the case statement.
							React-Redux does this for you in combineReducers.
						</aside>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>JS-Interop</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Ports are created in Elm to send and receive data from other JavaScript</li>
						<li>Flags can also be created for init-time configuration</li>
						<li>Cmd's are created and sent to ports</li>
						<li>Subscriptions on ports allow new data to come in</li>
						<li>JS has to be connected to ports outside of the Elm app, usually as part of the script tag in the HTML</li>
						<li>Data is sanitized coming in to Elm</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						This is exactly like sending and receiving messages
						from a WebSocket.
